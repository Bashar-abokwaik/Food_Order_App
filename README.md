# Food Order App

A food ordering web application built as a simulation of an e-commerce system, focused specifically on food orders.  
The project demonstrates how a real-world ordering flow works, from selecting meals to submitting an order.

## Project Overview
This application allows users to browse meals, add and remove items from a shopping cart, and submit an order by filling in their personal details through a form after confirming the cart.

The main goal of this project was to practice building a real-world React application that handles state, context, and asynchronous data fetching.

## Features
- Browse available meals
- Add meals to the cart
- Increase or decrease item quantity inside the cart
- Remove items from the cart
- Confirm cart before checkout
- Submit order using a user form
- Asynchronous data handling with APIs

## Technologies Used
- React
- JavaScript
- Context API
- Fetch API
- Async / Await

## Technical Highlights
- Cart state management using **React Context**
- Global state handling for cart items
- Asynchronous API communication using `fetch`
- Clean separation of components and logic

## Challenges
The most challenging part of this project was implementing the cart logic using React Context, especially when combined with React Router.  
Managing shared state across multiple pages while keeping the logic clean and predictable required careful planning and refactoring.

## Project Level
**Junior+**
